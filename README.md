# Whats on #

A single page app for event planning and management

### User Stories

```
As a user,
So I can plan to go to an event
I want to see a list of events and dates
```
```
As a user,
So I can plan my own event,
I  want to be able to post and event to the app
```
```
As a user,
So I cannot book an event that happened,
I only want to see upcoming events
```
```
As a user,
So I can easily plan my events,
I want to see the events in reverse chronological order
```
```
As a User,
So I can let other users know where the event is
I want to be able to add a city location to an event.
```
```
As a User,
So I can appropriately prepare for an event,
I want to access the weather forecast for the location.
```
```
As a Dev,
So the App is useful long-term,
I want to store the data locally.
```
```
As a Dev,
So people can use my app,
I want to deploy it.
```


### Approach

I will be starting by implementing the 2nd user story - posting an event as this will be needed to begin listing events.
